Override!

Sometimes youâ€™ll want one class that inherits from another to not only take on 
the methods and attributes of its parent, but to override one or more of them.

    print("Get back to work, %s!" % other.name)

ceo = CEO("Emily")
emp = Employee("Steve")
emp.greet(ceo)
# Hello, Emily
ceo.greet(emp)
# Get back to work, Steve!
