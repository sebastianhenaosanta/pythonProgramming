This Next Part is Key

A dictionary is similar to a list, but you access values by looking up a key instead of an index. A key can be any string or number. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces, like so:

d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}

This is a dictionary called d with three key-value pairs. The key 'key1' points to the value 1, 'key2' to 2, and so on.

Dictionaries are great for things like phone books (pairing a name with a phone number), login pages (pairing an e-mail address with a username), and more!


Print the values stored under the 'Sloth' and 'Burmese Python' keys. Accessing dictionary values by key is just like accessing list values by index:

residents['Puffin']# Gets the value 104
"""


# Assigning a dictionary with three key-value pairs to residents:
residents = {'Puffin' : 104, 'Sloth' : 105, 'Burmese Python' : 106}

print(residents['Puffin']) # Prints Puffin's room number
# Your code here!
print(residents['Sloth'])
print(residents['Burmese Python'])
