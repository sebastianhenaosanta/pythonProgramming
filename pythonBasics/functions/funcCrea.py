#Function Junction

"""
Functions are defined with three components:

The header, which includes the def keyword, the name of the function, 
and any parameters the function requires. Hereâ€™s an example:
    

def hello_world(): # There are no parameters

An optional comment that explains what the function does.


\"""Prints 'Hello World!\' to the console.\"""


The body, which describes the procedures the function carries out. 
The body is indented, just like conditional statements.

 print("Hello World!")

def hello_world():
  \"""Prints 'Hello World!' to the console.\"""
  print "Hello World!"
"""


def spam():
    print("Eggs!")
