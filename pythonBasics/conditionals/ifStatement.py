"""
elif is short for “else if.” It means exactly what it sounds like: “otherwise, if the following expression is true, do this!”

if 8 > 9:
  print "I don't get printed!"
elif 8 < 9:
  print "I get printed!"
else:
  print "I also don't get printed!"

In the example above, the elif statement is only checked if the original if statement is False.
