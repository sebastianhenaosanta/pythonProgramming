#Booleans
"""
Sometimes we have a need for variables that are either true or false. This datatype, which can only ever take one of two values, is called a boolean. In Python, we define booleans using the keywords True and False:

#code
a = True
b = False
#code

A boolean is actually a special case of an integer. A value of True corresponds to an integer value of 1, and will behave the same. A value of False corresponds to an integer value of 0.

# Hi! I'm Maria and I live in script.py.

age_is_12 = False
