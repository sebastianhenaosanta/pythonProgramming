"""
Write a function called censor that takes two strings, text and word, as input. It should return the text with the word you chose replaced with asterisks. For example:

censor("this hack is wack hack", "hack") ```

should return: 

```py
"this **** is wack ****"

    Assume your input strings wonâ€™t contain punctuation or upper case letters.
    The number of asterisks you put should correspond to the number of letters in the censored word.
