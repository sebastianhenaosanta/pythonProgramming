is_prime

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. (Thatâ€™s a mouthful!)

In other words, if you want to test if a number in a variable x is prime, then no other number should go into x evenly besides 1 and x. So 2 and 5 and 11 are all prime, but 4 and 18 and 21 are not.

If there is a number between 1 and x that goes in evenly, then x is not prime.
