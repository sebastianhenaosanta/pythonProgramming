scrabble_score

Scrabble is a game where players get points by spelling words. Words are scored by adding together the point values of each individual letter (weâ€™ll leave out the double and triple letter and word scores for now).

To the right is a dictionary containing all of the letters in the alphabet with their corresponding Scrabble point values.

For example: the word "Helix" would score 15 points due to the sum of the letters: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 8.
