Access by Index

You can access an individual item on the list by its index. An index is like an address that identifies the itemâ€™s place in the list. The index appears directly after the list name, in between brackets, like this: list_name[index].

List indices begin with 0, not 1! You access the first item in a list like this: list_name[0]. The second item in a list is at index 1: list_name[1]. Computer scientists love to start counting from zero.

#Exercise

Write a statement that prints the result of adding the second and fourth items of the list. Make sure to access the list by index!

numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]

print("Adding the numbers at indices 0 and 2...")
print(numbers[0] + numbers[2])
print("Adding the numbers at indices 1 and 3...")
# Your code here!
print(numbers[1]+numbers[3])
