For One and All

If you want to do something with every item in the list, you can use a for loop. If you’ve learned about for loops in JavaScript, pay close attention! They’re different in Python.

for variable in list_name:
  # Do stuff!

A variable name follows the for keyword; it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.

Then in list_name designates list_name as the list the loop will work on. The line ends with a colon (:) and the indented code that follows it will be executed once per item in the list.

Write a statement in the indented part of the for-loop that prints a number equal to 2 * number for every list item.

my_list = [1,9,3,8,5,7]

for number in my_list:
	print(number* 2)
