Remove a Few Things

Sometimes you need to remove something from a list.

beatles = ["john","paul","george","ringo","stuart"]
beatles.remove("stuart")
print beatles

This code will print:

 ["john","paul","george","ringo"]

    We create a list called beatles with 5 strings.
    Then, we remove the first item from beatles that matches the string "stuart". Note that .remove(item) does not return anything.
    Finally, we print out that list just to see that "stuart" was actually removed.

backpack = ['xylophone', 'dagger', 'tent', 'bread loaf']

backpack.remove('dagger')
