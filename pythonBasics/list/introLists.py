Introduction to Lists

Lists are a datatype you can use to store a collection of different pieces of information as a sequence under a single variable name. (Datatypes youâ€™ve already learned about include strings, numbers, and booleans.)

You can assign items to a list with an expression of the form

list_name = [item_1, item_2]

with the items in between brackets. A list can also be empty: empty_list = [].

Lists are very similar to strings, but there are a few key differences.
