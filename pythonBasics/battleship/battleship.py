Welcome to Battleship!

In this project you will build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship! In this version of the game, there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 10 guesses to try to sink the ship.

To build this game we will use our knowledge of lists, conditionals and functions in Python.
