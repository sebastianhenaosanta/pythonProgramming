Extracting Information

Notice how the output looks like 2013-11-25 23:45:14.317454. What if you donâ€™t want the entire date and time?

from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()

current_year = now.year
current_month = now.month
current_day = now.day

You already have the first two lines.

In the third line, we take the year (and only the year) from the variable now and store it in current_year.

In the fourth and fifth lines, we store the month and day from now.

print(now.year)

print(now.day)
